STREAmS-2 postprocessing routines for a Boundary Layer Simulation.

The routines have been written so that postprocessing of the data can be done in parallel.
Currently, the postprocessing utility can do the following things for you:

* Spatially average in spanwise direction and also the streamwise direction, which is only theoretically correct for a small \Delta X.
* Calculate average quantities for all points in the domain.
* Calculate spectral quantities.
